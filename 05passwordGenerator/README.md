# Strong password generator

Hello everyone,



 I'm excited to Share my  ReactJS   mini project🎬

#project #DAY2

A fully responsive, So it's look Awesome on any Device ⚡ 



here is live link of "password generator"-  https://password-generator-by-itspiyush78.netlify.app/



here is link of GitHub repository - https://github.com/itspiyush78/React-JS/tree/main/05passwordGenerator

Anyone can simply access a code 👆 



Concept I use to make this project mention below-

$  useState - Returns a statefull value, and a function to update it.

$  useCallback - useCallback will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the inputs has changed.

$ useEffect- Accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful       code.

$ useRef- useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.



Note that useRef() is useful for more than the ref attribute. It’s handy for keeping any mutable value around similar to how you’d use instance fields in classes.



Be sure to check it out !



And pls comment down your opinion related to this post



Thank you 🙏
